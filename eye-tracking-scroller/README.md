Description
-------------

Below is a description of both halves of the whole


>  **Webcam Pupil Detection**
>
> -  XML file contains cascade of tests (Haar's Cascade) which check whether object in a moving window is a face or not
> -  Create an object that uses the tests in the .xml file to extract faces from images sampled from webcam feed
> -  Localize eyes using empirical data and  Haar's Cascade.
> -  Identity the most prominent face in a frame and use Haar's Cascade to obtain the location of the eyes.


> **PDF Viewer using Tkinter**

> -  Created a canvas on a window of fixed dimensions
> -  Implemented yview.scroll and button placements to achieve scrolling in y direction
> -  Processed images to make a PDF fit in the x direction always
> -  Implemented custom function and image arrays to systematically remove and display page by page of a PDF on the click of a button.
