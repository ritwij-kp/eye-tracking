Welcome to Visual Scrolling Aid's documentation!
================================================

Project
-------

Project mainly aims to achieve the following

* Make a PDF Viewer on Tkinter
* Use OpenCV to locate position of the pupil in the eye
* Merge the above two functionalities to create a tool to scroll using eyes only

But we've had loads of difficulties along the way

* The PDF Viewer took long to set up due to no prior experience with GUI
* Integration couldn't be done due to the infinite loop nature of the PDF and the Pupil Tracker
* Implementation using buttons was done preliminarily but final integration couldn't be done due to execution of only one of the two
* Due to error in open cv2, coverage couldn't be implemented as the library raised module not found errors constantly despite proper installation
